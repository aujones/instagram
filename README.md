- [x] User can tap a post to view post details, including timestamp and creation
- [x] User can use a tab bar to switch between all "Instagram" posts and posts published only by the user.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [x] User Profiles:
- [x] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo

- [x] User can create and update a biography that appears on their profile
- [x] Edit profile button that takes user to a page where they can edit their profile picture/bio

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Adding filters
2. Further customizing/improving the app's aesthetic
